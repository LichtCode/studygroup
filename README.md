## Key Features

### 1. User Registration and Profile Setup
- Users can register with their email addresses and set up profiles.
- Profiles include fields like username, bio, and tags representing academic interests.
- Tags allow for personalized topic-based matching.

### 2. Topic Selection and Matching Logic
- Users can add multiple tags to their profiles.
- A dynamic matching algorithm pairs users with similar tags to form study groups.

### 3. Group Creation and Management
- Users can create study groups with unique names and IDs.
- Groups have descriptions, owners (creators), and associated tags.
- Other users can join groups using either the group name or unique ID.

### 4. Real-Time Chat Rooms
- Enables instant messaging within study groups.
- Built with Django Channels and WebSocket for efficient real-time communication.

### 5. Notification System
- Alerts users about upcoming study sessions.
- Notifications are sent via email or displayed in-app.

## Architecture and Technologies

### 1. Backend
- **Django Framework:** Provides a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
- **Django Channels:** Enables real-time communication through WebSocket.

### 2. Frontend
- **Django Templates:** Used for server-side rendering of HTML pages.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, such as dynamic tag inputs and chat features.
- **CSS:** Styles the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.

### 3. Database
- **SQL:** Manages relational data, including user profiles, tags, groups, and chat messages.

### 4. Third-Party Tools
- **Redis:** Serves as the message broker for Django Channels.
- **UUID:** Generates human-readable unique IDs for groups.

## Core Functionalities

### User Registration and Profile Setup
- The user model extends Django's default `AbstractUser` to include additional fields like `bio` and `tags`.
- Tags are managed through a Many-to-Many relationship.
- Users can dynamically add or remove tags via an intuitive frontend interface.

### Topic Matching Logic
- Matching occurs by comparing user tags to find shared interests.
- Matched users are suggested for collaboration and group formation.

### Group Management
- Groups are defined with a `name`, `description`, `owner`, `tags`, and a `UUID`.
- Users can join groups by entering the name or ID.

### Real-Time Messaging
- Chat functionality is implemented using Django Channels and WebSocket.
- Messages are stored in the database for persistence.

### Notifications
- Email and in-app notifications inform users of important updates, such as upcoming study sessions or group invitations.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Real-Time Features
Implementing real-time chat required handling WebSocket connections and ensuring efficient message broadcasting without overloading the server.

### 2. Topic Matching
Creating a robust matching algorithm that balances accuracy and performance posed initial difficulties.

### 3. User Experience
Ensuring a seamless user experience, particularly with dynamic tag input and group management, required iterative testing and refinement.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Planning for Scalability
Designing a scalable architecture early on prevented bottlenecks as features expanded.

### 2. Real-Time Communication
Integrating WebSocket-based features enhanced understanding of real-time technologies.

### 3. User Feedback
Incorporating feedback during testing improved the usability of the platform significantly.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Mobile Application
Develop a mobile app version for Android and iOS, ensuring accessibility on-the-go.

### 2. Advanced Matching
Integrate machine learning to provide more accurate user and group recommendations.

### 3. Moderation Tools
Add tools for managing user-generated content, such as reporting and moderation of inappropriate tags or messages.

### 5. Calendar Integration
Allow users to integrate their schedules with platforms like Google Calendar for streamlined session planning.
